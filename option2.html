    <p>Are you sure?<br>Kinda hurts to hear that, bcs the way you used to act and talkâ€¦ it really felt like you felt the same.<br>
    So none of that was real? Ehehehe<br>Itâ€™s okay though.<br>
    Thank you for the moments you made me feel loved.<br>
    But can we still be friends?<br>
    I mean, if there were no feelings to begin with, then staying friends shouldnâ€™t be a big deal, right?<br>
    Letâ€™s be friends again?</p>
