    <p>Hey…</p>

    <p>I’m sorry i had to reach out through my friend. Since i can’t contact you through any other way, this is the only option i have left. So, i’m writing this as my final message to you.</p>

    <p>I just wanted to let you know, i’m not crying over you anymore. But i still think about you, often. Sometimes, out of nowhere, i remember your random snaps, your random questions, your stories. Especially those stories about how love has hurt you, how it made you feel like you’re just not lucky in love.</p>

    <p>And i wonder…<br>
    If it’s not me by your side, will you still be okay?<br>
    Will your heart be safe?<br>
    Will the person you’re with love you as deeply as i do?<br>
    Will they be willing to lower their ego just to make things work with you?<br>
    Will they try to make things right when they mess up, just so your heart doesn’t break again?</p>

    <p>I’m not jealous. I’m just scared that you’ll get hurt again.</p>

    <p>Yes, it’ll break me if i find out you’re with someone else, whether now or later. But my worry for you still outweighs that jealousy.</p>

    <p>Will you be okay? Please don’t get hurt again. You deserve to be happy. You have to be happy. Since i won’t be the one walking through life with you, i hope you’ll protect your heart. If that person ends up being careless with it… don’t be sad. I’ll always be here, behind you.</p>

    <p>I’ll be the first to hold you if you need a hug. The one who picks up your midnight calls if you ever need to talk. Even if you only see me as a friend, a stranger, or just a backup when things get hard, i won’t stop making sure you’re okay.</p>

    <p>I’ll always find my way back to you, even if it means going quiet. Even if i no longer blow up your phone with long messages like i used to. I’ll keep chasing you, just not loudly this time. I won’t ever get tired of running after you, no matter how far you go, just to make sure you’re not alone, not worn out, not falling apart.</p>

    <div class="signature">
      <p>I love you,<br>As someone who may never get to call you mine.</p>
